## ✨ Features

### 🔢 Standard Calculator
- All basic operations (+, −, ×, ÷).  
- **Memory Functions** (MC, M+, M−).  
- **Percentage** button.  
- Copy result with one click **📋**.  
- Calculation **history log** with up to 25 records.  

### 🌙 Appearance & Usability
- Toggle **Dark/Light Theme**.  
- Modern UI styled like a mobile calculator.  
- Firework/spark animations 🎆 for feedback.  

### ☰ More Functions (Engineering Toolkit)
Click **More** to unlock advanced tools:  

- **π (Pi)** constant insertion.  
- **Roots & Powers**: √x, ∛x, x², x³.  
- **Geometry Calculators**:  
  - 🕳️ Circle Area (from diameter).  
  - 🛢️ Cylinder Volume (from diameter & height).  
  - 📐 Triangle Area (from three sides using Heron’s formula).  
- **Survey Unit Conversions**:  
  - Ft → m (Feet–Inch to Meters).  
  - m → Ft (Meters to Feet–Inch).  
  - ⛓️ → m (Chain–Link to Meters).  
  - m → ⛓️ (Meters to Chain–Link).  

### 🕒 Productivity
- **History Panel** → Revisit old calculations anytime.  
- **Error Handling** → Detects invalid inputs (e.g., impossible triangle sides).

## 📄 Example Usage
- Standard: `25 × 4 = 100`.  
- Circle: Input `12` (diameter) → Result = 113.10 (area).  
- Cylinder: Input `12-8` (d=12, h=8) → Result = 904.78 (volume).  
- Triangle: Input `3-4-5` → Result = 6 (area).  
- Conversion: `5-6` (5′6″) → 1.676 m.
