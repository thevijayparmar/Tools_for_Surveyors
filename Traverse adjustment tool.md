# 🧭 Traverse Adjustment Tool (v6.0)

A powerful **browser-based traverse computation and adjustment tool** built for **surveyors and civil engineers**.  
Supports both **bearing-distance** and **coordinate entry**, performs **Bowditch adjustment**, and provides rich **visual + tabular outputs**.  
Runs fully **offline in your browser** – no internet or installation required.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📂 Input Modes
- **Bearing + Distance** → Enter traverse legs using lengths and bearings.  
- **Coordinate Entry** → Options for:  
  - Manual entry of points.  
  - **CSV Upload** (auto-detect & map columns).  
  - **Sample Test Data** for quick demos.  

### ⚙️ Settings
- ✅ Assume Closed Traverse toggle.  
- ✅ Choose angle system: **Azimuth (0–360°)** or bearings.  
- 🌍 Choose coordinate system:  
  - **UTM / Projected** → Standard XY easting/northing.  
  - **GCS (Longitude/Latitude)** → Uses **haversine formula** for distances & geodetic bearings.  

### 🖼️ Visualization
- Interactive **sketch panel**:  
  - Red polyline → Original traverse with misclosure vector.  
  - Green polyline → Adjusted traverse (Bowditch).  
  - Click a **point** → Get ID, X, Y, and computed bearing.  
  - Click a **segment** → View segment length.  
  - Red dashed vector → **Misclosure line** with error magnitude.  
- Responsive redraw on resize.  

### 📊 Computation & Adjustment
- Calculates:  
  - Misclosure vector (ΔX, ΔY).  
  - Resultant error magnitude.  
  - Misclosure ratio (1 in N).  
  - Perimeter and area of traverse.  
- Applies **Bowditch Adjustment** to redistribute closure error.  
- Shows **original vs adjusted** coordinates and leg details.  

### 📑 Tabular Reports
- **Legs Table** → Original vs Adjusted lengths, bearings, ΔX, ΔY, corrections, and Δθ.  
- **Points Table** → Original vs Adjusted coordinates with δX, δY corrections.  
- **Summary Stats** → Misclosure, perimeter, area, and quality commentary.  

### 📤 Export Options
- Export **Legs CSV** (original vs adjusted).  
- Export **Points CSV** (original vs adjusted).  
- Retains **precision** based on input decimals.  

### 🎨 Usability
- Clean **Neumorphism UI** with modern cards.  
- Drag‑and‑drop row reordering.  
- History log with status/error messages.  
- **Reset** button to start fresh.
