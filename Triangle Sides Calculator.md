# 📐 Right‑Angle Triangle Field Calculator

A practical **offline field tool** for surveyors and engineers to quickly compute the **third side** of a right‑angled triangle.  
Ideal for marking right angles in the field using methods like **3‑4‑5 triangle** or for custom dimensions.  

---

## ✨ Features

### 🧮 Triangle Computation
- Enter **any two sides** → the tool computes the **third side** automatically.  
- Calculates all triangle properties:  
  - Base (a)  
  - Height (b)  
  - Hypotenuse (c)  
  - ∠ at base (θ), ∠ at height (φ), Right angle (90°).  
- Uses **Pythagoras theorem** in real time.  

### 🎨 Interactive Visualization
- Live **triangle sketch** updates with each input.  
- Computed side highlighted in **sky‑blue glow**.  
- Displays side lengths and angles directly on sketch.  
- Draws **right‑angle marker** at corner.  

### 🖥️ UI & Usability
- 🌗 **Dark/Light theme toggle** (remembers preference).  
- 🚦 **Error detection** for invalid inputs (e.g., hypotenuse shorter than legs).  
- Input highlighting:  
  - Recently entered values = green highlight.  
  - Auto‑computed side = blue highlight.  
- Animated “⚡ sparks” effect on computed side for visibility.  

### 📑 Formula & Explanation
- Shows **formula, substitution, calculation, and result** for transparency.  
- Example:  
  ```text
  Formula: c² = a² + b²
  Substitution: c² = 6² + 8²
  Calculation: √(36 + 64)
  Result: c = 10
  ```

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open **`Triangle Sides Calculator.html`** in your browser.  
2. Enter any two dimensions (Base, Height, or Hypotenuse).  
3. The third side and internal angles are computed instantly.  
4. Review the live triangle sketch + step‑by‑step formula.

## 📄 Example Use Case
- **Field marking of right angles**:  
  - Input Base = 9, Height = 12.  
  - Tool computes Hypotenuse = 15.  
  - Angles displayed: θ ≈ 53.13°, φ ≈ 36.87°.

## ⚡ Why Use This Tool?
- 🧑‍💼 Saves time in the **field** — no manual calculator needed.  
- 📐 Perfect for setting out right angles in construction and surveying.  
- 💻 Runs **fully offline** in any browser (desktop or mobile).  
- 🎯 Provides **visual + formula verification** for confidence.
