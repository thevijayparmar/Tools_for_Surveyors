# 🟦 Area Calculator of Known Shapes

A fun and interactive **browser-based tool** to calculate the area of common 2D shapes such as:  
**Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, Trapezoid, and Parallelogram** 🎉.  
Runs completely **offline** and works on any device with a browser.

## ✨ Features
- ➕ **Supports 6 Known Shapes**:
  - 🟦 Square → A = x²  
  - ⬛ Rectangle → A = b × h  
  - 🔺 Triangle → A = ½ × b × h  
  - ⚪ Circle → A = πr²  
  - ⬡ Trapezoid → A = ½(a + b) × h  
  - ▭ Parallelogram → A = b × h  
- 🎨 **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**  
- 🌟 **Animated Sparkle Effect** when results appear  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, or desktop  
- ⚡ **Instant Calculation** as you type your values
