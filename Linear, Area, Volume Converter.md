# 🧭 Surveyor Multi-Converter

A powerful **all-in-one offline conversion tool** designed for **land surveyors** and **civil engineers**.  
It helps in **linear, area, volume, and slope conversions** with support for both **international units** and **local Indian units** often used in field practice.  

Runs directly in your **browser without internet** — perfect for **fieldwork** where network access is limited.

## ✨ Features

### 🔁 Linear Conversion
- Convert between all standard linear units (m, cm, mm, km, inch, ft, yd, mi).  
- Special support for:  
  - **Chain & Link** (1 Chain = 16 Links, 1 Link = 0.629 m).  
  - **Feet–Inch Mode** (e.g., `5-6` = 5 feet 6 inches).  
- **Dual input modes**:  
  - Single value (decimal entry).  
  - Dual value (Chain–Link or Feet–Inch entry).  
- Results can be swapped instantly with the **⇄ Reverse Button**.  
- Copy results easily with the **📋 Copy Button**.  

### 📐 Area Conversion
- Supports all common area units (m², km², hectare, acre, ft², yd²).  
- Includes **local field units**:  
  - **Vaar (sq. yard)**  
  - **Guntha** (101.17 m²)  
  - **Small Vigha** (16 guntha = 1618.72 m²)  
  - **Vigha** (24 guntha = 2428.08 m²)  
  - **Are** (100 m²)  
  - **Brass (100 ft²)** – widely used in construction works.  
- Handles **compound input formats** like Vigha–Guntha (`3-5` = 3 Vigha 5 Guntha).  

### 📦 Volume Conversion
- Convert between m³, L, MLt, km³, ft³.  
- Includes **Brass (100 ft³)** – used in stone, aggregate, and concrete works.  

### ⛰️ Slope Conversion & Visualization
- Converts slope across **Degrees ↔ Percent ↔ 1 in N**.  
- Includes a **triangle visualization** of slope for better field understanding.  
- Handy for road, canal, and embankment engineers.

## 📄 Example Usage
- **Linear**: `5-6` (5 ft 6 in) → 1.676 m  
- **Area**: `3-5` (3 Vigha 5 Guntha) → 8064.5 m²  
- **Volume**: `1 Brass` → 100 ft³ = 2.8317 m³  
- **Slope**: `5°` → 8.75% = 1 in 11.43
